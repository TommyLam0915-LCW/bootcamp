public class FinalClass {
  // 1. Subclassing Restriction: A final class cannot be inherited or extended by any other class.
  // 2. Preventing Overrides: Final classes are often used to prevent modification to the class's behavior or to ensure that the implementation remain unchanged.
  // 3. Design Integrity: By making a class as final, you can ensure that the class's functionality, contracts or business logic remain consistent and unaltered.
  // 4. Efficiency: Final classes can offer performance benefits since they cannot be extended or overidden, allowing the compiler to make certain optimizations.
