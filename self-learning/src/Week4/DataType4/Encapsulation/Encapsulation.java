public class Encapsulation {
  // 1. Data Hiding : the internal state or data of an object is hidden from the outside world
  // protecting it from direct access or modification
  // 2. Access Modifiers : access modifiers (such as private, public
  // or protected) to control the visibility and accessibility of class members (fields and methods)
  // 3. Encapsulating Methods : can provide controlled access to the underlying data
  // enforcing data integrity, and implementing necessary logic or validation.
}
// Benefits of using Objects

// Information Hiding
// 1. Able to hide inner class and not allow users to know how the data and variables are stored
// 2. Able to make the fields of the calss write-only (if only setter method) or read-only (if only getter method)

// Code reuse
// It allows the programmer or a user to effectively use the existing code again and again

// Testability
// With encapsulation, it becomes much better for unit testing
